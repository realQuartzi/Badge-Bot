**How does Badge-Bot work?**

Badge bot works very simply. Just use the create command with the badge name and the bot will develop the badge in a database for you for your server. The bot will return to you the Badge ID and you can use this ID to reward other users with there Unique ID or also UserID.  
The reason we use the UserID is because it is the easiest to track the user as this value is unique to every user and cannot be changed.
